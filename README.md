# KidsGalaxy-Test
A DRF + React to-do list encompassing CRUD operations

Here we find 2 Folders:
- todo - Django Backend
- to-do-list - React Front-end

To start the Backend server:
- Inside the todo folder, `python manage.py runserver`

To start the Frontend server:
- Inside the to-do-list folder:
  - `npm i`
  - `npm start`

Note: Make sure that Django server is running on localhost:8000
You can change URL in `utils.js` in React

Basic To-Do List Application that encompasses all concepts required - CRUD operations, DRF and React.
The project works on SQLite, but can be set up for MySQL using `django-mysql`

Do reach out for anything. Thanks!
